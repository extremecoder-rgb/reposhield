# Philosophy

This tool does not attempt to guess intent.

It answers one question:

"Does this repository contain patterns that
increase operational or security risk?"

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Malware classification
- Attribution
- Behavioral prediction
- AI-driven verdicts

## Why No Machine Learning

- ML reduces explainability
- ML increases false confidence
- Security decisions require justification

This engine favors correctness and trust over recall.
